### Senior Frontend Engineer (Vue.js) — Building Scalable Applications That Drive Business Results

With 5+ years in the Vue.js ecosystem, I focus on bridging technical excellence with real business impact. I specialize in modernizing legacy systems, building scalable frontends, and improving performance across complex applications. My work consistently drives measurable results — faster delivery, better user experience, and higher product quality.

I enjoy leading migrations, shaping technical architecture, mentoring engineers, and creating development processes that elevate both the codebase and the team. I’ve delivered successful projects across enterprise domains—helping products become faster, more stable, and easier to grow.
